# Social Engineering Scam Detection using LLMs

## Objective
There is a social engineering tactic that cybercriminals use called phishing, where they use manipulation tactics to gather personal information. 
The goal of this project is to leverage LLMs paired with machine learning models to accurately identify phishing emails and texts.

## Datasets
- Enron Public Email Corpus dataset
- Spam Assassin Corpus dataset
- Phishing Pot dataset

## Methodology
* Data-preprocessing
* Feature extraction
* Training/Testing
* Model Evaluation
